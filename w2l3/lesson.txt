HTTP is always working in the dark.
It's stateless and memoryless. 

3xx errors imply that the site is not somewhere else, or something like that. 

If we are building our own server, you set up the page for every kind of error. 

From the client, you get a request with:
# Request code.
# Header.
# Body

From the server, you get a response with:
# Response code.
# Header.
# Body

SINATRA:

You HAVE to put ALL your views in the view folder. Must.
